          <p>Let's see hmmm... maybe they can redeem him...</p>
          <p>Even if that was possible can't you see there is no "redeeming" him. Don't you know what he's done? I mean really?!</p>
          <p>Nevermind that everyone deserves a second chance.</p>
          <p>Nevermind that? Are you serious? The only reason you are entertaining the idea of redemption is because it's your job. Well, my job is to see the world for what it is and believe me when I say there is no "coming back" for him.</p>
          <p>You're wrong about one thing. My job is not to redeem him that's what they're for. My job is to protect him emotionally, physically, mentally-- all the ly's. Even from you.</p>
